## What is Music-for-Music Modeling?

Music for music refers to represent both input/output sequences (including labels like chords, beats, textures, keys, structures) using the music modality itself. This unifies music understanding (music -> labels) and conditional generation (labels -> music) into the same form (music -> music).

## What is function alignment?

Function alignment is a [new theory of mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21106) that attributes human-like intelligence towards dynamic synergy among interacting agent (i.e., Language Models).
